## OVERVIEW

CheckmateX is an advanced chess engine designed for efficient and accurate gameplay. It utilizes a suite of sophisticated algorithms, including Min-Max, NegaMax, and Alpha-Beta Pruning, to analyze board states and generate optimal moves at high speed. A key feature is the integration of piece positional tables, which assigns strategic value to each piece's location, allowing the engine to make nuanced and intelligent decisions.

The engine's core functionality includes analyzing the current board, generating all possible moves, and accurately evaluating the strength of each move to select the most strategic option. This focus on deep analysis and strategic evaluation results in an engine that not only plays well but adapts effectively to an opponent's style. The project is under continuous development, with an ongoing commitment to optimizing performance and enhancing its algorithmic capabilities.</p>
